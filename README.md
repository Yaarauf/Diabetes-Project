# Diabetes-Project :
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. According to W.H.O, Diabetes is a major public health concern affecting hundreds of millions worldwide. Global Overview of Diabetes Distribution Prevalence as of recent WHO/IDF reports 537 million adults (20–79 years) were living with diabetes in 2021,projected to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045, almost 1 in 10 adults globally has diabetes 90–95%. Prevention and early detection are key in combating the rise of diabetes. If not managed properly, it can lead to severe health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and etc. By integrating awareness, education, lifestyle changes, and data driven healthcare solutions, we can mitigate the burden of this chronic disease and improve the quality of life for millions.
# Data Overview
Dataset Summary Number of rows: 768, Number of columns: 9, Column Names: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome.
# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on diagnostic health measurements. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess health data
- Apply logistic regression and evaluate model performance
- Identify key features that influence diabetes risk
- Visualize data distribution and results

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
Key Steps
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Feature selection and scaling
- Train-test split and model training
- Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Results
The logistic regression model achieved solid performance with an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set. Features like *Glucose, **BMI, and **Age* had significant influence on predictions.
