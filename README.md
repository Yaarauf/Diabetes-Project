# Diabetes-Project :
Diabetes is a  major public health chronic condition affecting hundreds of millions worldwide. It develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or fails to produce enough of it. This condition is closely linked to modern lifestyle habits. Daily activities such as eating patterns, physical activity levels, and stress management play a major role in determining diabetes risk. Consuming processed foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats, skipping meals, frequent snacking, and leading a sedentary lifestyle (sitting for long hours, minimal exercise) all contribute to elevated blood sugar levels over time. Additionally, chronic stress and poor sleep can disrupt hormonal balance, further increasing risk. Prevention and early detection are key in combating the rise of diabetes. By integrating awareness, education, lifestyle changes, and data-driven healthcare solutions, we can mitigate the burden of this chronic disease and improve the quality of life for millions.This project focuses on analyzing risk factors using a supervised machine learning task to predict the outcome of diabetes.
